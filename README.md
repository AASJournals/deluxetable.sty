# deluxetable

Implementation of deluxetable.sty, a LaTeX package that implements the 
aastex deluxetable environment. The deluxetable this implements is likely
older than, and therefor incompatible with in edge cases, deluxetable 
as implemented in aastex6.

This is based on deluxetable from the following URL:
http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/standard30/deluxetable.sty
with modifications to make it compatible with TeXLive-2016, as outlined
here:

# AAS Journals disclosure

This style file was forked from a version by Sean Lake, @odysseus9672. As stated above it does not provide the functionality of deluxetable > AASTeX6 but can be used as a standalone deluxetable implementation in LaTeX documents. We also thank the original author, Alexey Vikhlinin, for his work creating this set of macros.
